# Neural Style Transfer 

This is a PyTorch implementation of neural style transfer based on the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576) by Gatys et al. 
The aim is to transfer the artistic style of one image onto the content of another using a deep CNN (in this case a pre-trained VGG19 network).

Here is an example of the Taj Mahal mixed with the style The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh:
